The requirements for this app were: A grid-based inventory app that prompts users for login information and allows them to update their inventory. Both connected to a database that updates with each change 
and stores new usernames and passwords.  

The app also needs to prompt user for text permissions and a phone number so that they can get an alert when their inventory reaches zero. This required a login/create account screen, a screen containing the 
inventory, and a screen that collects the users number if they agree to text notifications. I took a bullet point approach to the assignment, but due to some confusion I was working through the project in the 
wrong language for a few weeks. In the future, I will work in terms of the most important features and how to get them to function properly- this will allow me to assess the scope of the project better and 
integrate features better. I began by making a list of requirements and looking through the course resources to find the solutions. I find this process to be the most helpful, then when I reach a roadblock I 
can reach out and use other resources. For testing, I worked through the expected workflow of an anticipated user needs and ensuring that failures along the way don't create anything other than an error message.
This process helped me work through a lot of my errors and allowed me to become more familiar with my code. I had to be very innovative when pivoting after my mistake; there was a lot of trial and error in my 
process and determining my workflow so that I could complete the project to the best of my ability. I would not say that this assignment is representative of the best work that I can do; but I think that login 
information database has a lot of potential.
